# Chama Computers MERN Project

Welcome to the Computer Shop MERN Project! This is a web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project allows users to view various computer products available in the shop and enables administrators to log in and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on products.

## Features

- Display of computer products available in the shop.
- User authentication for administrators.
- Admin dashboard for adding new products and deleting existing ones.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing product information.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend API.
- React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for user authentication.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- Bootstrap: Front-end framework for styling the application.
- bcryptjs: Library for hashing passwords.
